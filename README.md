# Xcode Awesome File templates

This repository serves as a storage for developers to ease their boilerplate code writing, get inspired and create custom file/project template and share it with the comunity.

## How to start

1. Create folder at this path: - `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/{Your custom group or just simply Source}` 
1. 
- Copy the file template from Xcode default template directory to the custom one we created step above `cp -R /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source/Swift\ File.xctemplate/ ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source/CustomTest.xctemplate`
- Get some of the templates in this git repo and insert them right away and enjoy.
3. [Optional] Start hacking and create custom template
4. Share with other people so you are awesome and get all the girls at the bar.

# TODOS: 

[ ] Create script which makes copying the template from Xcode directory to you 
[ ] Figure out generating project templates so we can figure out MVVM app with Flow Coordinator pattern right set.
